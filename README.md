# obsidian-auto-internal-link-encoding

This is a plugin that encodes the selected text to a name and sets the alias as that selected text, preventing external access and making the parent document the only way to access the information.
It helps complete the hierarchical structure between documents, ensuring clear relationships and systematic management of the information flow.
